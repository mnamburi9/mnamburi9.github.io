    <!-- ================= ABOUT ================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a software engineer with over a decade of experience working at the intersection
        of test automation, CI/CD infrastructure, and system-level validation.
        My background spans banking and real-time payments, embedded and firmware platforms,
        cloud-based applications, and large-scale enterprise systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve focused on building automation frameworks that are practical,
        maintainable, and closely aligned with how systems are actually used in production.
        I enjoy working on problems that involve complex integrations — whether that’s
        payment rails, firmware boot flows, or distributed cloud services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, I’ve been incorporating AI-assisted tooling into testing and development
        workflows, exploring how large language models can improve productivity,
        debugging, and test design without adding unnecessary complexity.
